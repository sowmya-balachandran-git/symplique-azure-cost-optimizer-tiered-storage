## Conversation: Azure Serverless Cost Optimization with Terraform, RBAC, Key Vault, Monitoring, and Backup

**User:** <<ImageDisplayed>> this is my architecture diagram for this scenario..........................We have a serverless architecture in Azure, where one of our services stores billing records in Azure Cosmos DB. The system is read-heavy, but records older than three months are rarely accessed.

Over the past few years, the database size has significantly grown, leading to increased costs. We need an efficient way to reduce costs while maintaining data availability......................................Record Size: Each billing record can be as large as 300 KB.

Total Records: The database currently holds over 2 million records.

Access Latency: When an old record is requested, it should still be served, with a response time in the order of seconds.........................................Please propose a detailed solution to optimize costs while ensuring the following:

- Simplicity & Ease of Implementation – The solution should be straightforward to deploy and maintain.
- No Data Loss & No Downtime – The transition should be seamless, without losing any records or requiring service downtime.
- No Changes to API Contracts – The existing read/write APIs for billing records must remain unchanged.

**ChatGPT:** [Explained multiple possible solutions using Azure Blob Storage, archiving old Cosmos DB data, using Terraform/Bash automation, etc.]

**User:** please help me with step by step approach

**ChatGPT:** [Provided detailed step-by-step approach]

**User:** i don't need zip file rather i prefer step by step in the conversation only

**ChatGPT:** [Adjusted answer to inline step-by-step explanation]

**User:** i need the above using bash scripting as I'm familiar with it

**ChatGPT:** [Converted the process to use Bash scripting]

**User:** can we implement it using terraform

**ChatGPT:** yes

**User:** Provide the full Terraform repo and also add a variables.tf file by providing sample values

**ChatGPT:** [Provided Terraform repo structure and variables.tf]

**User:** can we use IAM access for this scenario for security purpose

**ChatGPT:** yes and also provide some simple values where ever necessary

**ChatGPT:** [Added IAM-based access controls]

**User:** now create the entire github repo

**ChatGPT:** [Created repo zip]

**User:** can we also include Azure Key Vault for storing keys and integrate it with RBAC for more security

**ChatGPT:** [Integrated Key Vault with RBAC]

**User:** recreate the entire repo by adding RBAC and Azure key vault as well

**ChatGPT:** [Recreated repo]

**User:** integrate log analytics azure monitor as well to check for any anomalities as well as include back up for both cosmos db and blob storage for data recovery and add a cron job to delete backup if it is older than 7 days

**ChatGPT:** [Added monitoring, backup, and cleanup job]

**User:** in terraform/modules/monitoring/main.tf retention_in_days = 30 it should be 90 right? as in the scenario it is mentioned but records older than three months are rarely accessed and it should be moved to blob

**ChatGPT:** Correct — updated to retention_in_days = 90

**User:** is there a chance that the system could break. Consider the different problems we might face, how we would tackle them, and how we would fix them if we were to run your solution in a production environment that could impact thousands of users.

**ChatGPT:** [Explained failure points, mitigations, recovery plans]
